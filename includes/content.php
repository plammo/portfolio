						<br><br>But when it comes to work I believe in people first,
						 so I'd like to tell you a little bit about myself and why it would be great to work together.

						<p>I honestly believe you never stop learning, that's it's never too late, you're never too old and your brain is never too full.
						Looking back over the last few months I'm amazed at the things I've learned and the sheer number of topics I've covered.<br><br>It has been tough going 
						and there were certainly times when I thought I was never going to get through it all. But as tough as it's been, it's been rewarding and most importantly, 
						immensely enjoyable. The technologies and disciplines I have studied are:</p><br>

						<p>While I've pretty much enjoyed everything I've learnt over the last year (some bits more than others) my natural inclination is towards front-end design
						 and development. I enjoy everything about the design process and have a real interest in the wider considerations of campaign marketing and how a web presence 
						 fits into an overal marketing strategy.<br><br>
						 My plan now is to increase my skills and knowledge by taking on some projects for friends and family embedding what I have learnt and keeping on top of this 
						 constantly evolving industry.<br><br>
						 I'm looking forward to this new career that I've chosen and I believe that combining my past experience with the skills I have learnt now will make me
        				 a very valuable resource for the company I work with next.<br>
        				 If you think that maybe you have something that I could help with I'd be very pleased to hear from you.</p>

						<p>So I'm just finishing up at the design school where I attended an 
						immersive 3 month Web Front-End Design Bootcamp. This came directly after
						 graduating my Diploma of Web Development at the same design school.<br><br>
						The Diploma was intense and comprehensive and it made me realise that my 
						interest lay in front end design - hence the bootcamp.<br>I enjoy everything about conceptualising and creating
						a web presence, designing the overall look and feel, wireframing, and then coding it into life.
						There's nothing quite like the thrill of taking an idea and making it real.<br><br>
						By clicking on the images below you can see examples of the work I've produced over the last year or so.
						I hope you like what you see.
